# Development Handoff

This is the operational entry point for a new developer or agent. Product
decisions remain in the main design documents; see [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)
for a compact document map.

fesTerm's code, tests, documentation, and first-party assets are written
entirely by GitHub Copilot under human guidance. The human project owner
defines product direction, requirements, priorities, acceptance decisions,
and release authorization.

## Current State

Milestones 0 through 5 are implemented with native-window validation pending;
M6 is the open compatibility acceptance gate. The application now has
in-memory local-session tabs, Launcher and Settings surfaces, command palette,
custom title-bar chrome, and a configurable status bar. The terminal core, UI,
session lifecycle, PTY and serial backends, implemented native SSH transport,
configuration foundation, and GUI-independent native secret-store foundation
are separate crates.
M7 and M8 are implemented; M6 remains the open compatibility acceptance gate.
M9 scrollback/reflow and M10 packaging/updater work are substantially
implemented but retain the completion work recorded in `ROADMAP.md`.

At startup, the app loads `config.toml` from the native per-user project
configuration location (`com.fes.fesTerm`) or the explicit
`FESTERM_CONFIG_PATH` support/test override. Missing configuration starts with
defaults and creates nothing. Invalid or unreadable configuration also starts
with defaults, and Settings provides a content-free actionable diagnostic.
There is no in-app reload action; fesTerm re-reads the selected location only
on the next startup. When manually authored configuration enables a
workspace, its ordered Launcher, Settings, and local-session entries restore
at startup instead of the default local shell; local entries create fresh
PTYs from their profiles. Saved SSH entries restore in place as an **SSH
authentication required** surface with destination metadata pre-filled, but
never connect without fresh transient authentication. Runtime tab IDs are new
for each launch, and no terminal output, process, credential/key, channel, or
host-trust state is restored. No configuration is watched or edited by
fesTerm from outside the app. Workspace metadata, profiles (create, update,
delete, reorder), and all current Settings interface preferences save
automatically to the same selected source the moment they change - there is
no manual reload/save action anywhere in Settings. Workspace restoration
remains an explicit off-by-default preference; live-session close confirmation
remains on by default but can be disabled for consistent immediate close
behavior across every invocation path. Workspace saves preserve
the manually authored profiles and cover only ordered Launcher/Settings
surfaces, restored SSH authentication-required profile surfaces, and
configured-local profile tabs; default, ad-hoc, and live SSH sessions are
omitted. Existing saved SSH profiles can explicitly store or use a password
or a private key (with optional passphrase):
TOML receives only an opaque reference plus a `credential_kind` discriminant,
native storage is used only on a
background worker, and secret resolution occurs immediately before SSH
authentication ([ADR 0024](adr/0024-native-secret-store-stored-private-keys.md)
extends the original password-only slice). The
`festerm-secret-store` foundation uses macOS Keychain, Windows Credential
Manager, and Linux Secret Service over the logged-in session D-Bus (including
KWallet only through Secret Service integration). A locked or unavailable
native store remains an actionable condition with no insecure fallback.
Host-key trust can also persist: an accepted (or deliberately, explicitly
replaced) host key is remembered in plain, non-secret TOML
([ADR 0020](adr/0020-persistent-host-key-trust.md)), so reconnecting to an
already-trusted `host:port` no longer prompts.

SSH profiles may select a named `tmux` or GNU Screen strategy. Provider
sessions suppress their own status chrome and receive the actual initial
fesTerm viewport size; bounded automatic recovery is available only as a
separate per-launch opt-in. Plain SSH remains manual reconnect and always
creates a fresh shell. Real-provider create/detach/reattach evidence remains
tracked by [#49](https://github.com/fes/fesTerm/issues/49).

Saved Local profiles may also select the native `festerm-sessiond` durable
provider. Closing that tab detaches instead of terminating the shell, and the
Launcher can optionally surface unattached daemon sessions as one-click
Resume entries; the capability remains experimental pending ADR-0025's
remaining validation/security work.

Not implemented: OpenSSH configuration import, real keyboard-interactive/2FA
authentication ([#60](https://github.com/fes/fesTerm/issues/60)),
[#40](https://github.com/fes/fesTerm/issues/40) SSH-agent adapters, key-file
path references, color emoji/script-specific fallback, a custom GPU renderer,
terminfo distribution, and reference-TUI compatibility sign-off. M7 supplies transient
password and in-memory OpenSSH private-key authentication plus bounded opt-in
reconnect; for one-off (non-profile) connections, encrypted-key passphrases
remain transient in-memory parse inputs only. Read [`milestone-progress.md`](milestone-progress.md)
before choosing work.

The current single-row chrome follows ADR 0022: the focused chip retains its
natural width, inactive chips compact by water-filling to a 72 px floor, and
horizontal scrolling begins only after that exact budget is exhausted. New
Session stays fixed beside the strip during overflow and directly follows the
last chip when scrolling is unnecessary. Compact and full-density chips use
the same allocation contract.

M10's native package and updater infrastructure is implemented. Protected
GitHub Actions builds signed/notarized macOS DMG, signed Windows NSIS, Linux
AppImage, and Debian outputs; packaged builds expose explicit
check/download/install update states. Release credentials live only in the
protected `release` environment. Use
[`signing-and-release.md`](signing-and-release.md); the first production
release and end-to-end upgrade evidence remain
[#62](https://github.com/fes/fesTerm/issues/62).

## Bootstrap

The repository pins the stable Rust toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```sh
cargo build
cargo run -p festerm
```

Without an enabled workspace, the first run opens the singleton Launcher;
selecting Local Shell replaces that chip in place with the platform default
shell. Launcher and Settings remain available through application chrome. With
an enabled manually authored workspace, its
saved tab order/focus restores instead and users must authenticate again before
an SSH destination connects. If local-shell creation fails, the UI shows the
session error rather than substituting a demo shell.

## WSL 2 Development and Testing

Use a Linux-native checkout under the WSL home directory (for example,
`~/src/fesTerm`), not `/mnt/c/...`; this avoids cross-filesystem build and
file-watching problems. WSLg provides the GUI display when `DISPLAY` or
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set.

On Ubuntu, install the native build/GUI prerequisites and the P5 reference
tools:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential pkg-config libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libx11-dev \
  libvulkan-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers xvfb \
  vttest less vim-nox neovim tmux htop gh
```

Install Rust for the WSL user, then clone and build:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --profile minimal
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup toolchain install stable
mkdir -p ~/src
git clone https://github.com/fes/fesTerm.git ~/src/fesTerm
cd ~/src/fesTerm
cargo build --workspace
```

Run the GUI through WSLg with `cargo run -p festerm`. For Linux PTY P4 smoke
coverage, use the ignored tests in
[`native-smoke-policy.md`](native-smoke-policy.md); use `Xvfb` only for the
explicitly unfocused CI smoke. Run `vttest` and the reference
applications from the P5 checklist in this Linux checkout, recording
content-free evidence for each scenario. To run the optional scriptable P5
PTY probes for installed `less`, `nvim`, `htop`, and `tmux`, use
`scripts/run-p5-reference.sh`; see
[`m6-compatibility-checklist.md`](m6-compatibility-checklist.md) for its
content-free result format and manual-validation limits.

## Toolchain and Dependency Currency

Use the current stable Rust toolchain. Before starting a milestone work package
and before a release candidate, update the toolchain and resolve the current
stable releases of direct dependencies and their lockfile graph. A breaking
dependency update is a focused, cross-platform validated change rather than a
reason to retain an obsolete version constraint. Exact pins are allowed only
when behavior depends on versioned external data; document their rationale and
review them when updating the data.

```sh
rustup update stable
cargo update
```

The core's Unicode dependencies remain exact pins so cell-width behavior is
reproducible; update their fixtures and standards note in the same change.
The `egui`, `eframe`, and `egui_kittest` requirements deliberately track the
latest released 0.x line. `Cargo.lock` remains committed for reproducible
builds; refresh it through the validated dependency-update process rather than
tracking the upstream Git branch.

## Validation

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo check --workspace
git diff --check
```

For a manual local-PTY smoke check, run the app, type `printf 'hello\n'` on a
Unix shell or `echo hello` in the default Windows `cmd.exe`, resize the window,
then exit the shell. Unix integration tests also exercise controlled PTY I/O,
resize, exit, descendant shutdown, and bounded shutdown without a native
window. Windows CI runs a cfg-gated ConPTY test for spawn, output/input,
resize, exit, and shutdown.

To stage the reviewed optional Windows sidecar for the pinned retention smoke,
run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\stage-conpty.ps1 -RunSmoke
```

This command uses a per-user local application-data cache outside the
repository, verifies the archive and x64 file hashes from
`third_party/conpty/manifest.json`, builds the workspace, stages both test
layouts, and runs the pinned resize/content-continuity smoke. If Application
Control blocks the staged runtime, retain the policy failure as validation
evidence; do not bypass it.

## Optional Validation Suite

Prefer repository-owned automation to repeated manual validation instructions.
The global opt-in suite runs every currently automated optional probe: the P5
reference-application PTY probes, P6 renderer/snapshot validation, the P4
native-window smoke, and the repository-owned OpenSSH interoperability
fixture. It writes
content-free suite status only and exits nonzero when an invoked probe fails.
Run it from a logged-in desktop session; it opens and closes a native window.

```sh
FESTERM_RUN_OPTIONAL_VALIDATION=1 scripts/run-optional-validation.sh
```

```powershell
$env:FESTERM_RUN_OPTIONAL_VALIDATION = '1'
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\run-optional-validation.ps1
```

On Windows, the PowerShell entry point delegates the reviewed ConPTY staging
and retention smoke to `stage-conpty.ps1 -RunSmoke`; do not duplicate its
download or staging behavior. The suite remains opt-in because host GUI,
graphics, and installed reference applications vary. A `not-run` reference
tool is recorded by the P5 result file and is not acceptance evidence.

The OpenSSH suite builds an Alpine fixture, generates its server host keys and
password at container start, generates ephemeral unencrypted and encrypted
client keys outside the repository, and selects a randomized loopback host
port. The encrypted key's random passphrase is passed only to the test process
environment and is never persisted. It runs all ignored fixture tests serially,
including password and both public-key authentication forms. It also restarts
that same container to prove opt-in bounded reconnect, including a fresh
host-key decision and usable new shell; it does not claim shell-state
restoration. Run it alone with `scripts/run-openssh-interop.sh` or
`pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\run-openssh-interop.ps1`. If Docker CLI or its
daemon is unavailable, it records `status=skipped reason=docker-unavailable`;
an available Docker installation reports test failures normally.

### OpenSSH-derived acceptance matrix

The [OpenSSH portable `regress/`](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/tree/master/regress)
suite is a behavioral source for this matrix; fesTerm does not invoke, copy,
or adapt its CLI-coupled scripts. The repository-owned fixture remains
loopback-only and is the evidence for the scenarios below.

| Scenario | Status and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Password authentication | Implemented: a generated password authenticates the fixture user. |
| Unencrypted in-memory OpenSSH Ed25519 client key | Implemented: a runner-generated key is bind-mounted only as the fixture user's authorized key. |
| Encrypted in-memory OpenSSH Ed25519 client key | Implemented: a second runner-generated encrypted key is authorized alongside the unencrypted key; its random passphrase is supplied only through the test-process environment and is consumed during parsing. |
| ECDSA P-256 server host key | Implemented: the selected fixture profile exposes only its generated ECDSA P-256 host key; the test checks its runner-read SHA-256 fingerprint and canonical host/port prompt, accepts it once, then reaches a shell marker. |
| Remote PTY, shell, resize, output, and shutdown | Implemented through the controlled password session. |
| Bounded reconnect | Implemented: killing and restarting the same fixture requires a fresh trust decision and reaches a new shell marker; remote shell state is not restored. |
| Agent authentication | Deferred until fesTerm owns cross-platform agent adapters, user consent policy, and fixture coverage. |
| Port/X11/agent forwarding and SFTP | Deferred until channel APIs, authorization policy, lifecycle handling, and isolated fixture tests exist. |
| OpenSSH user/host certificates | Deferred until certificate selection and host-trust policy are exposed by fesTerm and covered by a dedicated fixture. |

The suite does not replace manual P5 observations that require screen
semantics or user intent: GitHub Copilot CLI, `vttest`, native
selection/focus, paste behavior, and application-specific visual inspection.
`tack` remains separate M10 evidence under #27. On Windows, the suite
additionally invokes `run-windows-os-input-smoke.ps1`, which uses real OS
focus, click, resize, and key events to prove the event-to-PTY path without
recording terminal content.

## Diagnostics and Safety

- For idle-rendering CPU regressions on a Windows desktop, build the workspace,
  set `FESTERM_RUN_OPTIONAL_VALIDATION=1`, and run
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\check-windows-idle-rendering.ps1`.
  It opens two isolated-config
  windows in sequence: maximized Launcher discovery and an idle background
  PowerShell tab with unread output. Each must average at most 5% of total
  machine CPU after warmup. Run without competing builds, and do not interact
  with or minimize the test windows during measurement. Add
  `-RequireSoftwareRenderer` to require WARP/another CPU adapter rather than
  treating a hardware-GPU run as software-renderer evidence. Results and
  local logs go under `target`; `-Executable` and `-ResultPath` support
  before/after comparisons. Logs retain the sensitivity boundary below.
  Add `-IncludeSustainedOutput` to measure a third window with a foreground
  PowerShell fixture updating a short line at 10 Hz. This case defaults to a
  30% CPU ceiling and at least five GUI frames built per second; override with
  `-MaximumOutputCpuPercent` and `-MinimumOutputFramesPerSecond` for a recorded
  machine-specific budget. The optional Windows suite includes this case.
  Frame counts come from content-free `festerm::rendering=debug` events and
  measure UI paint construction, not completed OS presentations. The script
  sets and restores its log filter. GPU pixel comparisons and native visual
  review remain separate oracles; Windows `PrintWindow` can return a stale
  startup image for GPU-rendered windows.
  The native solid-background path does not eliminate the cost of dense text,
  colored cells, or full-frame rendering.
- Required Windows CI runs Cargo's repository-owned test executables through
  `scripts\run-windows-tests.ps1`; see [native test exit diagnostics](windows-test-diagnostics.md).
  This is separate from the installed application's lifecycle journal below.
  It retains content-free exit/exception/termination, concurrent-thread stack
  and module metadata without retries, serialized tests, or uploaded dumps.
  The unexplained UI-test exit 2173 in [#330](https://github.com/fes/fesTerm/issues/330)
  remains unresolved pending a causal reproduction.
- `RUST_LOG` configures structured log filtering. The default is
  `festerm=info,warn`.
- For native responsiveness attribution, separately opt into
  `festerm::input_timing=debug`, `festerm::ui_timing=debug`,
  `egui_wgpu::frame_timing=debug`, or `egui_winit::pointer_input=debug`.
  The outer application forwards the native raw-input hook to the primary
  window; recording it only on the inner window app does not observe the
  shipped multi-window host.
  These record per-frame native pointer batch counts, application logic/UI
  durations, root host paint phases/primitive counts/surface policy, and
  adapted pointer positions/buttons/wheel deltas respectively, without
  document, keyboard or clipboard text. Input/UI `frame` is the count before
  `run_ui` completes; paint's
  `completed_frames` is that count plus one. Begin/end timestamps expose
  intervening gaps.
  Paint durations are not GPU timestamps or proof of display latency;
  configuration and acquisition are separate buckets, unavailable surfaces
  are logged before recovery/skip, and submission/presentation may wait.
  The targets do not
  add device polling, input replay, cursor-position substitution or repaint
  requests. Logs remain local; review before sharing.
  `festerm::pointer_selection=debug` additionally records the text widget's
  selected-character count, character-index anchor/endpoint and
  focus/hover/drag/button state, not selected text.
- fesTerm keeps local lifecycle metadata and logs under
  `diagnostics/runs-v2/<run-id>/` in its native per-user state directory.
  Each run owns its marker, exit intent, final record, at most one 256 KiB Rust
  panic report, and one 2 MiB application log; concurrent processes never rotate
  or overwrite each other's files. No report upload is implemented.
  Future explicit next-start review/consent and first-party Firebase-backed
  `feslabs.com` intake are tracked separately in
  [#232](https://github.com/fes/fesTerm/issues/232), including private storage,
  optional Sentry grouping, retention, idempotency, and abuse controls.
- The About/Copy Version Information summary uses lifecycle metadata, not raw
  report/log contents. **Raw panic messages, backtraces, and ordinary tracing
  logs are not scrubbed and may contain sensitive data, including user paths,
  terminal-derived values, or secrets from application/dependency errors.**
  Not intentionally recording terminal traffic is not a guarantee that these
  files contain no terminal content or secrets. Keep them local and review/redact
  before sharing; About explicitly warns about this boundary.
- Native smoke runs instead write beside `FESTERM_NATIVE_SMOKE_RESULT_PATH`,
  appending `.diagnostics` to that path, so smoke exits and forced runner
  termination do not contaminate the real user's exit history. Missing/empty
  smoke result configuration disables durable diagnostics with a warning rather
  than falling back to the user journal. These isolated files follow the same
  sensitivity/retention rules; the runner owns their cleanup.
- An OS-held lifetime lock, not PID existence or age, distinguishes live runs
  from abandoned ones. A permanent `diagnostics/catalog.lock` serializes
  creation, scanning, and retention; never delete lock files while fesTerm is
  running. Catalog acquisition has a two-second deadline. Diagnostic errors
  are reported through tracing/stderr and a content-free About warning rather
  than preventing GUI startup. A panic hook uses a nonblocking journal lock;
  if busy, it warns that the report could not be written. An independently
  published panic flag preserves the panic even when a concurrent finish has
  already chosen a clean record.
- At each startup, retain the five newest inactive failed runs and five newest
  inactive clean runs, including their logs/reports. Active runs are exempt
  until a later startup observes their locks released. About reports the
  newest retained failure, or the newest clean exit if no failure remains;
  unrelated clean exits cannot hide an unclean run. This startup snapshot is
  not a live process monitor. A caught worker panic remains a panic even if the
  event loop later returns normally. Native faults, forced termination, and
  power loss remain unclean/unknown, not a diagnosed cause.
- Old experimental shared files directly inside `diagnostics/` are left
  untouched and excluded from v2 scanning: their markers cannot safely
  distinguish an older still-running binary from an abandoned run. After all
  older processes stop, those legacy files can be archived or removed manually.
  Atomic file replacement avoids deleting valid evidence before a replacement
  succeeds; Unix parent directories are synced, but this is not a guarantee
  against every filesystem or hardware power-loss failure.
- `FESTERM_PROTOCOL_TRACE=1` only reports that tracing was requested; terminal
  content tracing is intentionally not implemented.
- `FESTERM_CONFIG_PATH` selects a non-empty Unicode configuration-file path
  instead of the native per-user location. It is intended for support and
  tests; configuration diagnostics intentionally omit the selected path and
  source TOML. This narrower contract does not sanitize arbitrary panic
  payloads or other tracing messages.
- The normal status line is compact; use the **Diagnostics** control to reveal
  lifecycle, queue pressure, bytes, errors, resize, and input-to-paint-
  submission details, plus per-frame render diagnostics (frame time, dirty
  row count) appended from `festerm-ui-egui`'s `TerminalView`. Backend event
  delivery requests an egui repaint, so an idle window does not need a
  polling timer to show output.
- Terminal content, clipboard values, and credentials are sensitive. Do not add
  them to fixtures, logs, or diagnostics by default.

## Resuming Work

1. Check `git status --short` and the latest `ROADMAP.md` milestone status.
2. Review open GitHub issues at milestone start and before release; classify
   defects against current completion criteria, schedule compatible reports in
   their owning milestone, and retain future product requests without pulling
   them into the current scope.
3. Read the matching requirements and compatibility sections before editing.
4. Preserve the ownership flow: PTY output -> app -> core -> UI, and UI input
   -> core encoder -> app -> session.
5. Add deterministic fixtures or isolated tests for compatibility fixes.
6. Keep status documentation current only after the corresponding behavior and
   validation exist.

Milestone 6 is the open acceptance gate. Use the
[compatibility checklist](m6-compatibility-checklist.md) for reference-
application scenarios and the [M6 automation backlog](ui-test-plan.md#m6-automation-backlog)
for implementation order. P0 through P2 are implemented; prioritize P3 visual
evidence, P4 real-window validation, and P5 manual reference-application
evidence against the exact candidate recorded in the acceptance document. M7
and M8 are implemented. Keep remaining M9 work and M10 release validation
bounded by their existing ADRs/issues, and convert every corrected failure into
a concrete regression before broadening scope.
