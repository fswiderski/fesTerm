# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture decision records preserve decisions that affect the project across subsystems or over time. They record context and consequences so future changes can revisit the reasoning rather than only the result.

- [ADR 0032: Single-Process Multi-Window via egui Viewports](0032-single-process-multi-window.md) — see issue #119
- [ADR 0033: Moving Tabs Between Windows](0033-moving-tabs-between-windows.md) — builds on ADR 0032
- [ADR 0035: Syntax Highlighting as a Cached View of Parsed Text](0035-syntax-highlighting.md) — extends ADR 0034's document/view split to tree-sitter highlighting
- [ADR 0036: The Core Reports Colors From an Embedder-Supplied Scheme](0036-embedder-color-scheme-in-core.md) — keeps `OSC 4/10/11/12` answers in `festerm-core` while `festerm-ui-egui` owns the values; see issue #222
- [ADR 0037: Reverse Wraparound Climbs Only the Line It Is On](0037-reverse-wraparound-bounds.md) — implements `DECSET 45` with xterm's post-383 bounds and retires stale soft-wrap marks on explicit line breaks
- [ADR 0038: Authoritative Terminal Snapshots for `festerm-sessiond` Reattach Recovery](0038-sessiond-terminal-recovery-snapshots.md) — updates ADR 0025's recovery model to use protocol-v2 terminal snapshots rather than raw replay tails
- [ADR 0043: Immutable Native Font Atlas Snapshots](0043-immutable-native-font-atlas-snapshots.md) - narrowly vendored non-consuming identity and bounded context snapshot ownership only; native CPU/resource/presentation/latency qualification remains open under #298 and CP-18
- [ADR 0045: Native Atlas Admission Before Capture](0045-native-atlas-admission-before-capture.md) - accepted backend-owned metadata preflight; changes only ADR 0043's oversized capture ordering, with existing limits/fallback preserved
- [ADR 0039: Direct2D Terminal Composition on Supported Windows x64 WARP](0039-opt-in-direct2d-terminal-composition.md) - automatic supported-route policy and ownership; broader native qualification remains open
- [ADR 0040: Automatic Final-Target Terminal Copy](0040-opt-in-final-target-terminal-copy.md) - owner-approved bounded WARP rollout without production switches
- [ADR 0041: Automatic Retained Window Prefix](0041-opt-in-retained-window-prefix.md) - owner-approved exact immutable prefix reuse; resource/native/latency follow-ups remain in #282

## Superseded Decisions

- [ADR 0008: Versioned TOML Configuration with Safe Hot Reload](0008-versioned-toml-configuration.md) — superseded by ADR 0015

## Proposed Decisions

- [ADR 0046: Opt-In Retained Document Frame](0046-opt-in-retained-document-frame.md) - owner-authorized default-off WARP experiment; exact complete-frame reuse shares ADR 0041's bounded cache

- [ADR 0044: Bounded Ordinary Terminal Row Paint Cache](0044-bounded-ordinary-terminal-row-paint-cache.md) - issue #327's internal presentation repair; independent gates and 52-run cleanup qualification complete, owner accepts the residual shaped-heavy CPU tradeoff under #334; external PR review remains required

- [ADR 0042: Isolated iOS Rendering Spike Host](0042-ios-rendering-spike-host.md) — Phase 1 implementation for review; native feasibility pending

- [ADR 0025: fesTerm-Owned Local Session Persistence via a Standalone `festerm-sessiond` Executable](0025-native-local-session-persistence-daemon.md)
- [ADR 0027: SSH Port Forwarding for Profiles and Live Sessions](0027-ssh-port-forwarding-for-profiles-and-live-sessions.md) — see issue #38
- [ADR 0028: Text-Mode SFTP Session Tabs via `russh-sftp`](0028-text-mode-sftp-session-tabs-via-russh-sftp.md)
- [ADR 0029: GUI SFTP File Manager Surface](0029-gui-sftp-file-manager.md) — see `docs/sftp-ui-design.md`
- [ADR 0030: Native Markdown Viewer as a First-Class Bounded Application Surface](0030-native-markdown-viewer.md) — amended by ADR 0034
- [ADR 0031: Mobile (iOS/Android) Port Strategy](0031-mobile-ios-android-port-strategy.md) — exploratory design only; see `docs/mobile-port-plan.md`, `docs/mobile-layout-design.md`, and `docs/mobile-signing-and-release.md`
- [ADR 0034: Shared Mutable Documents for Native Text Editing](0034-shared-mutable-text-documents.md) — amends ADR 0030's read-only snapshot boundary; see issue #166

## Status Values

- **Proposed:** under discussion and not yet binding.
- **Accepted:** the current project decision.
- **Superseded:** replaced by a later ADR.
- **Rejected:** considered and deliberately not adopted.

New decisions should use the next sequential number and should link to any ADR they supersede.
Start from [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md). Every new or materially changed ADR
must include `## Validation impact` and update the machine-readable trace
registry when its requirement, scenario, or evidence relationships change.
