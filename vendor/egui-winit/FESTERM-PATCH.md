# fesTerm clipboard provenance patch

Source: crates.io `egui-winit` **0.36.1**, registry checksum
`9327fc8edef2c57db9bcbcacc82c8a4b1e8cc64cd41a67db4419dcf643d88c83`.
Original MIT/Apache-2.0 licenses accompany the source. The workspace
`[patch.crates-io]` selects this source reproducibly; no installed registry
source is modified.

Local changes in `src/lib.rs` keyboard adaptation:

* emit the exact logical/physical key, pressed state, modifiers and native
  repeat flag immediately before derived Copy/Cut/Paste, including empty paste;
* exclude Ctrl+Alt (AltGr) from clipboard command classification;
* permit layout text associated with Ctrl+Alt rather than suppressing it as a
  command. macOS Command remains a command.

No clipboard payload is logged. Ordinary egui widgets still receive their
semantic events. The composition root can now remove a derived event for
terminal pass-through or app capture without guessing from a later modifier
snapshot. Widget RequestPaste intent remains unpaired. eframe's
`raw_input_hook` alone cannot recover information discarded by the unpatched
adapter. Keep this patch small, review it whenever egui is upgraded, and remove
it when upstream provides an equivalent supported provenance/raw-input seam.

`clipboard_requests.rs` adds an identified clipboard-read mailbox, served once
by `State::take_egui_input` on an explicitly requested next native frame. It is
not a clipboard watcher. Each viewport retains at most one request and one
response; identifiers never wrap or get reused. Cancelled/superseded callback
IDs cannot complete a newer read. The application keeps only content-free
tab/generation/ownership metadata and routes the returned payload through its
existing paste safety policy, never through an unowned widget Paste event.
The mailbox temporarily transports the same clipboard text that ordinary
egui Paste delivery transports, without logging or persisting it.

The app depends directly on this same pinned egui-winit package to use that
small seam; no second clipboard implementation or registry source edit is used.
Native clipboard key payloads already delivered alongside their key are used
directly, not discarded and reread. The opt-in native keyboard fixture writes
controlled clipboard text and invokes palette Paste to exercise this seam.

See `docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md` and the production routing regression tests.

The separately opt-in `egui_winit::pointer_input` debug target records adapted
pointer positions, button identity, pressed/released state and wheel deltas for native
input-ordering investigations. It does not log keyboard events, text or
clipboard data, and does not change input delivery or query the current OS
cursor to replace historical event coordinates.
