# fesTerm batched-pointer selection repair

Source: crates.io `egui` **0.36.1**, registry checksum
`c977ac91dfaa651633fd9722e4ce9ccb32cda4c748b89a5cb57e504036e37c13`.
The extracted package and its MIT/Apache-2.0 licenses are retained. The
workspace patch selects this same source for eframe, the app and egui_kittest;
installed registry sources are not modified.

The only production differences are in `text_selection/text_cursor_state.rs`,
`text_selection/label_text_selection.rs` and `widgets/text_edit/builder.rs`.
TextEdit and selectable labels derive the new selection anchor from the
already-delivered press event, transformed into the widget's own coordinates,
instead of the final pointer position of a pass that also contains movement.
The endpoint remains the current pointer cursor. The original public
`TextCursorState::pointer_interaction` signature remains available.

There is no input injection, replay, cursor polling, OS-coordinate substitution,
extra event storage, repaint request or rendering synchronization. The fix
applies regardless of renderer: slow frame delivery makes batching more likely
but is not required to reproduce it. Document bytes are unchanged; selection
and semantic Copy remain ordinary egui behavior.

Deterministic application regressions cover forward/reverse/Shift selection,
Unicode and translated layers, separate and combined within-widget batches,
disabled/clipped/modal ownership, actual Markdown Preview/Split prose and
table cells, and ordinary cross-paragraph Copy. The label clipping rectangle
is transformed into the same global coordinates as its galley. Complete
cross-widget press/move/release batching is not qualified by this patch;
egui's generic interaction admission still uses the final hit-test position.

Keep the diff against the checksum-verified upstream source small. Revalidate
or remove this patch when upgrading egui; do not treat this selection repair
as resolution of broader WARP rendering stalls or native clipboard routing.
